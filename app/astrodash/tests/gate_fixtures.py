"""Shared fixtures for the gated-model access gate.

The shipped roster contains no gated model -- that is the point of the
capability, not an oversight -- so every test that needs one builds it here:
``dataclasses.replace`` over a real definition plus a patched roster (KTD9).
A fixture built this way never passes through the import-time validators, so a
test that wants to exercise an invariant calls the validator directly rather
than reloading modules.

The gate's deployment values are patched in the same way, and the classify view
is driven with its services mocked, so nothing here needs model weights, network
access, or a configured deployment.
